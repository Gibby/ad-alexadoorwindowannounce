Alexa announces your doors/windows opening and closing. Comes in handy for garage doors or side/main exits for houses and shops where you need to stay informed of the doors/windows state when it changes.

Please ‚≠ê this repo if you like my work and also check out my other repos like

Also, if you want to see a walkthrough of my Home Assistant configuration, I have my video walkthrough on youtube below

This app wouldn't be possible without the amazing work done by the developers and community at **[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)**, and of Keaton Taylor and Alan Tse on their **Alexa Media Player integration** for Home Assistant. *https://github.com/custom-components/alexa_media_player*

It's a secured feeling to know the status of your garage or main/side exits. Ever since we've set this up in our home, now we don't think we can do without it. Your home suddenly gets a voice, something like Jarvis ... awesome ! 

If you like my work and feel gracious, you can buy me a beer below ;)
